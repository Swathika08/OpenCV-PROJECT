# OpenCV-PROJECT
ALERT SYSTEM FOR DRIVER'S DROWSINESS
This is project that aims to prevent 4 wheeler accidents by detecting driver's drowsiness and fatigue.For this we use python OpenCV to monitor the real time situation of the driver and sending the alerts to the arduino uno board which is connected to vibration motor that gives haptic alert to the driver.We also aim to provide alerts to the public through an OLED display that gives real time situation to the driver.
